So I found the solution:

The yolo.h5 file can be generated using the YAD2K repository here: https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K

Steps how to do it on windows:

Clone the above repository to your computer

Download the yolo.weights file from here: http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights

Download the yolo.cfg file form here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/cfg/yolo.cfg

Copy the downloaded weights and cfg files to the YAD2K master directory

Run python yad2k.py yolo.cfg yolo.weights model_data/yolo.h5 on the shell and the h5 file will be generated.
